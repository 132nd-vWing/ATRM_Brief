## CAS Dynamic scenario
- CAS, Range 14:  [CAS Mission](/ATRM_Brief/Pages/R14_CAS_TASK.html)

## CAS, pre-set static scenarios
- CAS preset scenario #1
- CAS preset scenario #2
- CAS preset scenario #3

The random pre-set CAS scenarios are aimed to provide the JTAC with practicing a rapid preparation of his situation updates based on details provided by a simulated Ground Force Commander.

How-To-Use:

- Once in the mission, first take TACTICAL COMMANDER or JTAC roles and then man one of the JTAC units of RANGE-14 (The purpose of this is to allow receiving of messages generated only for specific users once the CAS scenario is activated. **This step is essential!**
- In the F10 menu, select ACTIVATE R14 PRESET CAS SCENARIO RANDOMLY. This would display the GFC-briefing to you providing you with the situation , priorities, restrictions and other scenario-specific information. It is highly advised to screenshot this screen so that the brief can be read later on as needed.
The briefing relates to the [GFC-JTAC Coordination Map](https://cloud.132virtualwing.org/s/RdHNqBNkNNgwWiP)
- The JTAC/FAC(A) should use the GFC-brief message provided in conjunction with the map to orient himself in the range and prepare the required AO-update and additional details for the CAS flights as needed.
After a few minutes, The "regular" JTAC units of the range will deactivate and only the scenario-specific JTACs would be available (The GFC brief also states the LATLONG of your JTAC position for this scenario).
- Similarly, the scenarios can also be selected specifically rather than randomly by choosing "R14 CAS Preset scenario 1", "R14 CAS Preset scenario2" etc.

**NOTES:** 
1) due to the location of the JTAC units for those scenarios, terrain masking can be expected. It is therefore advised to choose and coordinate CPs that are either SE or NW of the range center so as to minimize terrain-masking impact on the initial comms with the arriving CAS flights.

2) The preset CAS scenarios incorporate enemy SAM units. Those units will be using their radars but would not actually engage aircraft (This is a training scenario after all...). For this reason, please advise other participants in the event of the probable presence of SAM radars in R14 just so that it won't interfere with training activities of other flights in adjacent ranges.

## CAS, basic pre-set scenario
The basic preset scenario sets some static units at the range and is suitable for basic CAS trainings. As opposed to the "1" and "2" preset scenarios, the units included in the basic scenario are all visible and controllable from the F10 map so that the JTAC can make adjustments to the range setup.

## CAS pre-set scenario #1

**SITUATION:**
1) The enemy has launched an attack against our villages and outposts near the international border.<br>
2) A friendly border outpost has been evacuated and the few combat vehicles we have there are deployed on defensive positions on a hill EAST of the outpost trying to stop enemy advancing forces.<br>
3) As the friendly units were repositioning they took some artillery fire. The POO (Point Of Origin) is estimated to be approximately NW 3nm from the outpost.<br>
4) Enemy strength estimated at an armored company reinforced with some mechanized and motorized elements.<br>
5) A friendly UAV dispatched after the attack began was apparently shot down. A smoke trail was visible coming from the NORTH but no ID on the type.<br>
6) Fire support: a PALADIN 155mm battery is under JTAC / GFC control.<br>
7) GFC intent for CAS is to suppress the enemy offensive and defend the outpost until friendly reinforcements can arrive (will be coming from the SOUTH along the road).<br>
8) Mission target priorities are:<br>
8a) Armored and mechanized units : Prioritize unit commanders / leading vehicles. Destroy remaining combat vehicles only if you have sufficient ordnance and time<br>
8b) Enemy artillery, including recon/ forward observers.<br>
8c) Enemy C2<br>

## CAS pre-set scenario #2
**SITUATION:**
1) Our front company is launching an offensive against enemy frontline units to the NORTH.<br>
2) Friendly task force consist of two platoons of M1 ABRAMs and M2 BRADLEYs<br>
3) Offensive plan is to advance North, eliminate enemy opposition in the area and secure vantage points (OBJ-A and OBJ-B) to provide cover for the advance of the rest of the our brigade to the North.<br>
4) Known enemy opposition consists of a mechanized company reinforced with an armored platoon and supported by short range air defenses.<br>
5) Fire support: a battery of PALADIN 155mm is deployed at N24 34.1 / E056 03.8 and is under direct control of the JTAC/ GFC.<br>
6) GFC intents for CAS:<br>
6a) Degrade the enemy force by at least 50%. Priority targets are MBTs, RECON, IFVs and C2s.<br>
6b) The ground maneuver is to commence our offensive after the CAS effort began its attack on enemy units in the area.<br>
7) JTAC O.P is located at N24 37.9 / E055 57.4 elev 2340ft.<br>
8) RESTRICTIONS: T3 is only approved until friendly units begin their advance. Once they start moving only T1 and T2 are approved.<br>

## CAS pre-set scenario #3
**SITUATION:**
1) A critical MSR running SW to NE is being used for resupplying our forces in the East coast.<br>
2) The road has been blocked by an enemy attack. Enemy evaluated as a commando force, strength 1+ company.<br>
3) The enemy commandos have seized a group of small villages around N24 39.0 / E056 07.0. The enemy has also seized adjacent vantage points and was able to close the road.<br>
4) A friendly resupply convoy traveling on that road came under attack and was destroyed. The convoy consisted of supply trucks and APCs.<br>
5) Allied command had intermittient contact with some survivors from the convoy who're still hiding close to the location of the ambush and are in critical condition.<br>
6) A friendly QRF (Quick Reaction Force) is set to counterattack into the area from the WEST, QRFs mission is to secure OBJ-A and OBJ-B and secure the survivors of the convoy.<br>
7) The QRF is staging at N24 36.9 / E056 04.0 and consists of an armored section , a mechanized platoon and a medical team on APCs- all Western type vehicles.  <br>
8) The QRF is under control of the GFC / JTAC (Not moving automatically).<br>
9) JTAC O.P is located at is N24 37.4 / E056 06.2 .<br>
10) GFC intent for CAS: <br>
10a) Get a positive position of the convoy's ambush location and locate the survivors.<br>
10b) Evaluate enemy disposition. <br>
10c) Destroy all threats to QRF. Prioritize IFVs, ATGM / RPG teams and artillery assets.<br>

## AR Scenario
- AR, Range 14:  [AR Mission](/ATRM_Brief/Pages/R14_AR_TASK.html)

## Customized scenario
In addition to the scenarios listed above, there are units availeble for spawning to setup a customized scenario. 
This can be used for both AR and CAS as required. This require all units to be manually placed.



## Admin
- To activate CAS scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate CAS scenario 1 +  "Activate Anti Air at Range 14" (If SAMs are required for training)
- To activate AR scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate AR scenario 1 "
- To activate units for use in customized scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate on demand units"
- When Range 15 or 16 is in use, make sure to deconflict with Range 15 and 16 user.
