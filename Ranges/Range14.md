# Range 14

## Description
Range 14 is a multipurpose range.

Intended for : CAS / FAC(A) / JTAC / AR / SCAR

## CAS Dynamic scenario
- CAS, Range 14:  [CAS Mission](/ATRM_Brief/Pages/R14_CAS_TASK.html)

## CAS, pre-set static scenarios
- CAS preset scenario #1
- CAS preset scenario #2

The random pre-set CAS scenarios are aimed to provide the JTAC with practicing a rapid preparation of his situation updates based on details provided by a simulated Ground Force Commander.

How-To-Use:
Once in the mission, first take any slot of a USA airframe and then switch to TACTICAL COMMANDER or JTAC (The purpose of this is to allow receiving of messages generated only for specific users. This step is essential!
In the F10 menu, select ACTIVATE RANGE-14 PRESET CAS SCENARIO RANDOMLY. This would display the GFC-briefing to you providing you with the situation , priorities, restrictions and other scenario-specific information. It is highly advised to screenshot this screen so that the brief can be read later on as needed.
The briefing relates to this map:

The JTAC/FAC(A) should use the GFC-brief message provided in conjunction with the map to orient himself in the range and prepare the required AO-update and additional details for the CAS flights as needed.
After a few minutes, The "regular" JTAC units of the range will deactivate and only the scenario-specific JTAC would be available (The GFC brief also states the LATLONG of your JTAC position for this scenario).
Similarly, the scenarios can also be selected specifically rather than randomly by choosing "CAS Preset scenario 1", CAS Preset scenario2" etc.

NOTE: due to the location of the JTAC units for those scenarios, terrain masking can be expected. It is therefore advised to choose and coordinate CPs that are either SE or NW of the range center so as to minimize terrain-masking impact on the initial comms with the arriving CAS flights.

## CAS, basic pre-set scenario
-The basic preset scenario sets some static units at the range and is suitable for basic CAS trainings. As opposed to the "1" and "2" preset scenarios, the units included in the basic scenario are all visible and controllable from the F10 map so that the JTAC can make adjustments to the range setup.

## AR Scenario
- AR, Range 14:  [AR Mission](/ATRM_Brief/Pages/R14_AR_TASK.html)

## Customized scenario
In addition to the scenarios listed above, there are units availeble for spawning to setup a customized scenario. 
This can be used for both AR and CAS as required. This require all units to be manually placed.



## Admin
- To activate CAS scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate CAS scenario 1 +  "Activate Anti Air at Range 14" (If SAMs are required for training)
- To activate AR scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate AR scenario 1 "
- To activate units for use in customized scenario, use F10 menu: "Activate on demand units"
- When Range 15 or 16 is in use, make sure to deconflict with Range 15 and 16 user.
