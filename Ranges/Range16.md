# Range 16

## Description
Range 16 is a multipurpose range. Intended for : CAS / FAC(A) / JTAC / AR

Primary purpose is basic CAS training for JTACs.


## Basic Close Air Support Scenario
Enemy territory is to the WEST. Friendly territory to the EAST.
In the target area , a friendly motorized infantry platoon have encountered a stronger enemy force. Friendly forces are pinned down in a village
and surrounded by enemy forces to the NORTH, SOUTH and WEST.
Intelligence indicate that  enemy in the area is a motorized infantry company, supported by  mortar and a platoon of MBTs.
We have reportings of an enemy SA-9 5km WEST of friendly position IVO enemy mortar position.

Ground Force Commanders (GFC) intention for CAS: Support the friendly forces and provide CAS to neutralize high value targets

GFC priorities:
- Priority 1: Main Battle Tanks
- Priority 2: Infantry fighting vehicles
- Priority 3: Artillery / Mortars  (HOWEVER, IF MORTARS START FIRING, THEY ARE PRIORITY 1).

GFC have approved Type 1, Type 2 and Type 2 Airborne observer. Type 3. Is approved outside 1km of friendly forces.
Dange Close: GFC initials: H.M. For danger close attacks only Type 1 is approved. For Type one, only forward firing munitions approved (guns+rockets)

Friendly forces are supported by a mortar position further to the EAST.

Western military equipment is friendlies
Eastern military equipment is enemy forces

What you can see is what the scenario is. You will have friendly units on F10 map as you are able to communicate with friendly forces
and know where they are. Enemy units are hidden from the F10 map and you need to scan the target area to locate enemy forces.

## RANGE 16 CAS PRESET SCENARIO #2

Ground Force Commander (GFC) briefing for scenario-2:
SITUATION
A friendly special operations (SOF) team callsign PREDATOR is located in a hostile village behind enemy lines.
PREDATOR was conducting SIGINT gathering when it has been compromised.
PREDATOR position is in a house at N24 47.640 / E056 08.485. PREDATOR has two HMMWV vehicles parked outside. They are currently working on tearing down their SIGINT gear and once ready they will use the two HMMWV to exfil the area towards the South.

An enemy force consisting at least one motorized company has entered the region. PREDATOR reports intercepting transmissions about enemy infantry teams with RPGs deploying to the South of their position along with roadblocks deployed around their position. They also indicate of a mechanized force of at least one company inbound from the North-West

JTAC position is on the ridge at N24 45.8 / E056 08.2

The FLOT is running East-West through the small village at N24 45.8 / E056 10.0

With no friendly forces that are combat-capable, it is up to the CAS assets to ensure the safety of PREDATOR by:
1) Target any enemy forces closing in on VENOMs location
2) Ensure the exfil route for VENOM is cleared of any threats
