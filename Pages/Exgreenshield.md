## ADMIN NOTES
- Due to this beeing a training scenario, there are not a full enemy mechanized Division (243 IFVs +++) placed out in the terrain. 
However, there are several units, both platoon, company and battalion sizes that can be located.
- Signature equipment (SAMs, artillery, logistics, HQ) are in place so it is possible to understand and interpret what is going on and where units
are located and how they are organized.
