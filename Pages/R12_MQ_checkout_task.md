### Weather forecast
OVERCAST at 25000ft, calm winds


#### Friendly situation
Friendly battalions are lined up in defensive positions along the FLOT. These units consist of primary motorized infantry, with some armor and mechanized infantry in reserve.


#### Enemy situation - Air
RED FORCE have 3 FW squadrons doing both A-A and A-G missions. In addition, RED FORCE have AWACS (E-2) and a couple of tankers (KC-135, KC-135 MPRS and S-3 Viking)
- Squadron 1: F-14B (Armed with AIM-7 and AIM-9)
- Squadron 2: F/A-18C (Armed with AIM-120C and AIM-9M)
- Squadron 3: F-16C (Armed with AIM-120C and AIM-9M)

Squadron 1 and 2 rotates between shore-based and on a Carrier somewhere in the ocean. <br>
<br>
RED FORCE are using the following airbases:
- Fujairah
- Ras Al Khaimah
- Khasab

RED FORCE normal way of operating is having one flight on QRA alert on one of the airbases or the carrier. Earlier missions indicate that the QRA flight is on a 15 minute alert.<br>
So, once a BLUE aircraft passes the FLOT, one can expect the QRA to be scrambled to try to intercept. At the same time, additional aircrafts may be scrambled based on the availability.<br>


#### SAM threats
RED FORCE have several SAMs protecting their territory. The static sites are shown in the picture below:

In addition to the static sites as shown on the picture, RED FORCE air defences operate IAW the following doctrine:

## Mission
Mission is to conduct a strike against 1x Bed Down Location (BDL) and 1x Meething location where intelligence indicate that an general from RED FORCE is staying the next 8 hours. <br>
It is important that both targets get hit, as we do not know in which building the general is occupying.<br>
