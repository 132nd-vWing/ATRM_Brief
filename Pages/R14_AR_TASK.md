# Range 14 Armed Reconnisance Tasking

## Scenario
Last known position for RED FORCE 21st Armored Regiment was in the vicinity of SUBAKH (N24 43.200 E056 10.800).
The 21st Armored Regiment is assessed to be RED FORCE Main Effort in its offensive to take Al Ain from BLUE FORCE.
Yesterday RED FORCE were able to break through BLUE lines to the SOUTH with their 12th Motorized Regiment, and are now conducting a big push into the desert in a move likely to cut off supplies to BLUE FORCES 
in Al Ain.
The intelligence section reports that this is an indicator for the imminent attack at Al Ain. 

Currently we do not have any eyes on RED FORCE 21st Armored Regiment, as all friendlies in the area have retreated further back to the FLOT.
