## Scenario
The Virtual Intelligence Service (VIS) have been able to identify and locate a outpost used by RED FORCES special operations forces.<br>
The outpost is located in the following grid: N23 52.350 E056 12.950<br>
Yesterday intelligence were able to intercept transmissions indicating a meeting taking place between the RED FORCE special forces commander present in the outpost, and a the leader of 31st Mechanized Regiment.<br>
It is assessed that the topic of the meeting is handover of information about BLUE FORCES positions along the FLOT, to identify weaknesses to be exploited by 31st Mechanized Regiment during the upcoming attack against Al Ain.<br>
The Commander of BLUE FORCES have assigned both Special Forces Commander and 31st Mechanized Regiment Commander as High Value Targets (HVT's) on the target list:
- HVT ALPHA: Special Forces Commander
- HVT BRAVO: 31st Mechanized Regiment Commander
<br>

During the cover of darkness last night, a  friendly special forces team was inserted into a hill roughly in grid: N23 55.100 E056 10.700. <br>
JTAC Warrior is part of this team, and are supporting effort to neutralize the targets.
