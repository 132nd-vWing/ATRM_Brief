# Range 12 Armed Reconnaissance Tasking

## Scenario
A Regimental Headquarter of the 123rd Motorized Regiment is located in killbox NEPTUNE. Intelligence indicate that RED FORCE are increasing their prescense in the area to prepare for an offensive
against BLUE FORCE. Due to lacking coverage the last 24 hours, we do not know if the Regiment is still in their barracks or if they have left their barracks.
It is anticipated that before an offensive is starting, the Regiment will disperse and move into field positions. An important indicator is thus if the forces are still present at their base or out in the field.

## Admin
- Scenario need to be activated via F10 menu
- Threatsites can be setup and activated using the F10 menu to create a scenario. (Each indiviual threat site must be enabled/acivated before selecting IADS Medium or Hard)
- At the end of each road is a outpost / roadblock. This is to prevent other traffic coming into the range, and shows the border of the search.
- The killbox does not mean that flights need to be within the killbox at all times. The killbox indicates where the targets are expected, and when activating the killbox no one else will
fly into the killbox without coordinating with the one tasked to use the killbox.
- High Value Targets should be attacked immediatly if discovered.
- Civilian buildings within the killbox are part of the range complex, but are to be treated as civilian buildings.
